				<h3>Basic Information</h3>

				<p>More information to come, but here are the basics... You and your teammates must register for the weekend, first. 
                Then you can build a team using the Teams tab above.</p>

				<p>Christians of all ages are encouraged to join a team, or just come and watch the fun!</p>
	 
				<p>Teams of 12 to 20 people will compete in 10 categories of challenges. You will want to build your team 
				carefully. You might include people who have at least one of the following characteristics: resourceful, 
				artistic, witty, quick reflexes, a pioneer in the church, constructive, shorter than 5 feet...</p>
	 
				<p>Each category of challenges may include portions for an individual, for partners or for the whole team.</p>
	 
				<p>To participate, you must register for the weekend and add your name to this event. <b>The deadline is Sunday, Dec. 16th.</b>
				We can make room for anyone who wants to participate, but we need you to sign up so we can plan accordingly.</p>

				<h3>Family Games Rules</h3>

				<ol type="1">
					<li>Teams must have a minimum of 12, maximum of 20 participants. We encourage, but don&#39;t 
						necessarily require, you to include people of multiple ages and from other congregations.</li>
				
					<li>Challenges have 10 categories: Athletic, Problem-Solving, Music, Know Your Minister, 
					Common Sense, Place of Safety Survivor, Artistic, Minute-to-Win-It, Construction, Current 
					(or Not So Current) Events, and the Grand Finale.</li>
				
					<li>Challenges will have multiple tasks. </li>
				
					<li>Each challenge category will be designated one of three ways:</li>
				
					<ol type="a">
						<li>All Play: The whole team will work together to complete tasks in the challenge. This 
						might be simultaneously or having one person go at a time.</li>
						
						<li>Partner Up: Two members of the team will work together on a task in the challenge. 
						(Need different partners for each task.)</li>
						
						<li>Flying Solo: One person from the team will complete a task alone. ***Choose 
						carefully, because as soon as someone has contributed to a &quot;Flying Solo&quot; 
						challenge, he or she may not complete any other tasks in that challenge category.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<li>Scoring: Each task in a challenge will be scored on a pass/fail basis. Bonus points may 
					be available in certain categories.</li>
				</ol>
