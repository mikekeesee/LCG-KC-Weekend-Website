				<h2>Dance</h2>

				<p>Swing your partner, do-si-do. Line 'em up and here we go!</p>
				
				<p>The theme for this year's dance is country-western, so don your boots and hat and give us a big YEE-HAW! (We thought this would 
				be appropriate for our ranch location.) This does NOT mean our music will all be country, so city folks, 
				bring your finest skills to the dance floor. Blue jeans and casual clothes are acceptable.</p>
	
			</div>

			<div id="funshow">
				<p>Last year's show was such a hit that we are again offering a family fun show. Our talent search is on, 
				and we are now accepting applications. If you can sing, dance, play an instrument, perform in a skit 
				or wow us all with some other amazing skill, then send in your application now.</p>

				<p>Space is limited, so we do reserve the right to screen or decline applications. Please email <a href="mailto:davidandsarahmanning@hotmail.com">
				David and Sarah Manning</a> to request the Fun Show application form.</p>

				<p>The same dress code as the dance (casual) applies, since the dance and fun show
				will occur in the same building.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="food">
				<p>It wouldn&#39;t be the KC Weekend without some tasty home cookin&#39;. This year&#39;s menu for Saturday night is 
				still in the works, but you can count on warm and hearty deliciousness.</p>

				<p>Benjamin Ranch is not very close to easily accessible restaurants, so we hope you'll plan
				to enjoy plenty of fellowship, feasting and festivities! The building is more than big enough
				to accommodate everyone for dinner.</p>
