		<p>Welcome to the activities page. This year we will again offer children&#39;s and family activities, full-court
		basketball, team volleyball and recreational volleyball. We have rented out the
		<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=okun+field+house&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=44.388698,62.753906&ie=UTF8&hq=okun+field+house&hnear=&ll=39.031603,-94.820058&spn=0.010684,0.015321&t=h&z=16">
		Okun Fieldhouse</a>, which will house all of the activities for the entire weekend.</p>

		<p>To meet a broader range of interests for our guests, we are also planning a <a href="announcements.php#seminar">seminar</a> on Sunday morning.
		This <a href="announcements.php#seminar">seminar</a> will occur during the sports activities, so guests will have to choose one or the other.
		However, we will be offering children&#39;s activities during the seminar, so adults can better attend.</p>
		
		<p>Family activities will be held after the seminar. The sports will take a break and everyone will have an opportunity
		to play together!</p>

		<p>Signing up for an activity helps us to gauge the number of people interested in each activity, so please <a href="activity-add-activity.php">sign up</a>.</p>
		
		<p><b>Important: Minimum age for sports is 13. Those with bad backs or other similar injuries should not
		participate. Due to the inherent risk of such activities, all participates must sign a liability waiver. Those
		under 18 will need a parent or legal guardian’s signature before they can participate.</b></p>
