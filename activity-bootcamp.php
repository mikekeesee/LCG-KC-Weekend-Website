		<h2>Boot Camp Conditioning</h2>

		<p>If you would love to get a great morning workout, this is the place for you! While basketball and volleyball are starting
		on other courts, you can join Lori Haden for an hour of cardio and conditioning. She will put you through stations
		to boost your heart rate and strengthen your body (and mind).</p>

		<p>All ages are welcome and no pre-registration is necessary. Just show up ready to sweat at 9:30 Sunday morning!</p>

		<p>For more information, please email Lori at <a href="mailto:princessloridenise@sbcglobal.net">PrincessLoriDenise@sbcglobal.net</a>.</p>
