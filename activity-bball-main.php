				<h3>Basic Information</h3>

					<p>More information to come, but here are the basics... You and your teammates must register for the weekend, first. Then you can build a team using the Teams tab above.</p>
					
					<!--<p>There will be tournament style play again this year. Depending on the number of teams, it will be like last year where we had a pool play in the morning and the top 4 teams went on to a single elimination tournament the second half of the day. Every team is guaranteed at least 3 games even if you do not make the single elimination tournament.</p>
 
					<p>Referees will be hired again and paid for with team fees. Last year the team fee was $65 and, depending on the number of teams, we expect it to be about the same this year. There will no refunds if your team withdraws after Dec. 21.</p>
 
					<p>Registration for your basketball team is a two-step process. You may begin your registration even all of your team members are not yet registered. <b>To register your team, click on the"Teams" tab above.</b> We request only captains register teams and change the roster.</p>
 
					<p><b style="color:red">You must register and finalize your team by noon on Monday, Dec. 17.</b> After that date, we will send the captains an email notifying them of the amount of the team fee. <b style="color:red">To complete your team registration, you must send payment to us via Paypal by Thursday, Dec. 21.</b></p>-->
					
					<p>Teams must have a minimum of 5 players to be included in the tournament. Maximum number of players on a team is 8. <b>All the team members must be registered and listed on the roster by Dec. 15.</b></p>

					<p>Games will be played based on high school rules. Games will begin promptly with no exceptions. A penalty will be assessed against your team if it is late or short players.</p>

					<p><b>All participants are required to attend the Sports Bible Study Sunday morning. Attendance is mandatory to play.</b></p>

				<h3>Kansas City Regional Family Weekend Basketball Rules</h3>

				<p>National Federation rules will serve as a basis for all situations not specified below. Normal full-court
				rules will apply, with an emphasis on the following rules or changes to the rules:</p>

				<ul class="bullets">
					<li class="bullets"><u>Start of Game:</u> Each game will begin with a jump ball.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Personal Fouls:</u> Each player has five (5) personal fouls to give before fouling out.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Team Fouls:</u> One-and-one situations will occur starting with the seventh (7th) team foul (no 2-shot bonus
					beyond this point).</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Free Throws:</u> The ball is live after the shot leaves the player&#39;s hands, not
					after it hits the rim of the basket.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Substitutions:</u> Allowed only during a dead ball after checking in	with the scorekeeper.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Timeouts:</u> There are no team timeouts.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Clock:</u> Time will not stop during the first half except under referee discretion.
					The clock will stop in the last minute of the second half for dead ball situations if the difference in scores
					is 10 points or less.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Overtime:</u> If the score is tied, a free throw shoot-off will determine the winner.
					Three players from each team will alternate shooting free throws two at a time per player.
					If it&#39;s tied after 6 shots, then the 4th player from each team shoots a single free throw, then the 5th player,
					and so forth until one team makes a free throw and the other misses.</li>
