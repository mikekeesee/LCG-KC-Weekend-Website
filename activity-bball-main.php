				<h3>General Information</h3>

					<p>The Kansas City Weekend provides a rare opportunity for Church members from around the country to get
					together and play organized sports. Our overall goals for sports this year are to promote teamwork,
					sportsmanship, camaraderie, playing within the rules of the game, strategy and, most
					importantly, fun.</p>

					<p>With these in mind, the following items have been determined:

					<ul class="bullets">
						<li class="bullets"><b>Sports Bible Study Sunday morning:</b> Attendance is <u>mandatory</u> to play.
						<li class="bullets"><b>Schedule of Games:</b> Schedule and tournament info to come.</li>
						<li class="bullets"><b>Rosters:</b> Teams need a minimum of 5 people per team (8 max.). All team members must register
						to play.</li>
						<li class="bullets"><b>Lunch Break:</b> All sports will halt for lunch. Schedule to come.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>Please register your team by <span style="color:red;">Sunday, December 18</span></b>.</p>

				<h3>Kansas City Regional Family Weekend Basketball Rules</h3>

				<p>National Federation rules will serve as a basis for all situations not specified below. Normal full-court
				rules will apply, with an emphasis on the following rules or changes to the rules:</p>

				<ul class="bullets">
					<li class="bullets"><u>Start of Game:</u> Each game will begin with a jump ball.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Personal Fouls:</u> Each player has four (4) personal fouls to give before fouling out.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Team Fouls:</u> One-and-one situations will occur starting with the seventh (7th) team foul (no 2-shot bonus
					beyond this point).</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Free Throws:</u> The ball is live after the shot leaves the player&#39;s hands, not
					after it hits the rim of the basket.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Substitutions:</u> Allowed only during a dead ball after checking in	with the scorekeeper.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Timeouts:</u> There are no team timeouts.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Clock:</u> Time will not stop during the first half except under referee discretion.
					The clock will stop in the last minute of the second half for dead ball situations if the difference in scores
					is 10 points or less.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Overtime:</u> If the score is tied, a free throw shoot-off will determine the winner.
					Three players from each team will alternate shooting free throws two at a time per player.
					If it&#39;s tied after 6 shots, then the 4th player from each team shoots a single free throw, then the 5th player,
					and so forth until one team makes a free throw and the other misses.</li>
