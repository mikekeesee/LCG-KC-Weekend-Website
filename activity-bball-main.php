				<h3>General Information</h3>

					<p>Registration is now open for the weekend and basketball. It is imperative that you register with
					your team at the earliest possible time. You do not need a full roster to register a team. It may be 
					filled out as you find players but register your team quickly.</p>
 
					<p>It is vital that you do this early this year because we are intending to hire referees. All the 
					cost of the referees will be offset by those playing basketball this. It has not been determined 
					whether this will be in the form of a per player or per team fee and is in addition to the requested 
					donation. We anticipate the total cost of the referees to be around $500 for the day. We cannot 
					assure there will be referees without enough early support for this by having your team register 
					as soon as possible.</p>
 
					<p>The format for play this year will be as follows. Two games for every team will be scheduled 
					in the morning. Based on the morning’s results, the top teams will advance to a playoff in the 
					afternoon. The rest of the teams will be scheduled another game in the afternoon as well. Every 
					team is guaranteed at least 3 games.</p>
 
					<p>Registration ends December 18 at which time every captain must send a confirmation that they 
					will be at the Kansas City Weekend and pay shortly their after so we can secure the referees. 
					There will be no refunds.</p>
 
					<p>As last year, there is a mandatory Sports Bible Study Sunday morning at 9:00 am at the Okun 
					Fieldhouse for all participating in basketball and volleyball. Both tournaments begin at 9:30. 
					Warm-up time is from 8:30 to 9:00 am. Games will begin promptly with no exceptions. A penalty 
					will be assessed against your team if it is late or short players.</p>
 
					<p>Games will be played based on high school rules. The exact format of games will depend on 
					the number of teams. </p>

					<p>With these in mind, the following items have been determined:</p>

					<ul class="bullets">
						<li class="bullets"><b>Sports Bible Study Sunday morning:</b> Attendance is <u>mandatory</u> to play.
						<li class="bullets"><b>Schedule of Games:</b> Schedule and tournament info to come.</li>
						<li class="bullets"><b>Rosters:</b> Teams need a minimum of 5 people per team (8 max.). All team members must register
						to play.</li>
						<li class="bullets"><b>Lunch Break:</b> All sports will halt for lunch. Schedule to come.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>Please register your team by <span style="color:red;">Sunday, December 18</span></b>.</p>

				<h3>Kansas City Regional Family Weekend Basketball Rules</h3>

				<p>National Federation rules will serve as a basis for all situations not specified below. Normal full-court
				rules will apply, with an emphasis on the following rules or changes to the rules:</p>

				<ul class="bullets">
					<li class="bullets"><u>Start of Game:</u> Each game will begin with a jump ball.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Personal Fouls:</u> Each player has four (4) personal fouls to give before fouling out.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Team Fouls:</u> One-and-one situations will occur starting with the seventh (7th) team foul (no 2-shot bonus
					beyond this point).</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Free Throws:</u> The ball is live after the shot leaves the player&#39;s hands, not
					after it hits the rim of the basket.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Substitutions:</u> Allowed only during a dead ball after checking in	with the scorekeeper.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Timeouts:</u> There are no team timeouts.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Clock:</u> Time will not stop during the first half except under referee discretion.
					The clock will stop in the last minute of the second half for dead ball situations if the difference in scores
					is 10 points or less.</li>
					<li class="bullets"><u>Overtime:</u> If the score is tied, a free throw shoot-off will determine the winner.
					Three players from each team will alternate shooting free throws two at a time per player.
					If it&#39;s tied after 6 shots, then the 4th player from each team shoots a single free throw, then the 5th player,
					and so forth until one team makes a free throw and the other misses.</li>
