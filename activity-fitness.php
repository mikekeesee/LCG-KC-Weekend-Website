		<h2>Fitness Conditioning Class</h2>

		<img src="images/fitness-activity.jpg" style="float:right;margin:0 1em;" height="240" width="220" />
		
		<p>Join Lori, our very own Fitness Fashionista, for a muscle conditioning and cardio class. It doesn't require an early morning wake up to make it to this class. Just bring some workout clothes and let Lori teach you about taking care of your body. She will put you through stations to boost your heart rate and strengthen your body (and mind).</p>

		<p>The class will begin mid to late morning, specific time forthcoming, and last about an hour. Get your cardio and conditioning in while you are away from home or learn something new. If you love a great morning workout or want to learn, this is the place for you!</p>

		<p>All ages are welcome. No pre-registration is necessary. However, if you are very interested in the class, go to the 
		<a href="http://kcweekend.moluf.net/activity-add-activity.php">Activities</a> page to sign up if you are not playing basketball or volleyball so we can gauge interest in the class.</p>

		<p>For more information, please email Lori at <a href="mailto:princessloridenise@sbcglobal.net">PrincessLoriDenise@sbcglobal.net</a>.</p>
