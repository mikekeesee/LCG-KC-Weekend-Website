				<h2>A Royal Gathering</h2>

				upon a time in a land not too far from wherever &#39;tis you are, there was a marvelous ball held in a
				magical land near the Summit of Lee. This was indeed a ball worthy of the most dignified and noble
				folk in the land--even, dare I say... Oh dare! ROYALTY!!</p>

				<p style="font-size:16px">And thusly, henceforth and figgle-feathers, all who descended upon
				this glorious event were draped in their regal wear befitting a kingly heir with imperial flair that
				might cause some to... stare.</p>

				<p style="font-size:16px">But nonetheless, all flocked to the illustrious ball and feasted and danced.
				As it has been in former times, so it shall be this second day of January at the seventh hour past
				noonday, that all who come hither to the Summit of Lee and dress in royal garb shall surely frolick
				frivolously with pomp and glee not seen since the days of yore.</p>

				<p style="font-size:16px">Furtherly such, the guild of minstrels from King Louis XIV&#39;s &quot;new
				world&quot; acquisition, J.R. Wells and the Baton Rouge Band, shall descend upon us this year and regale
				us with their &quot;new world&quot; sound.</p>

				<p style="font-size:16px">We&#39;ll see y&#39;all there... Ahem, many pardons. Good day, Your Highness.</p>

				<br/>
				<p><b><i>If you are not wearing a costume, the dress code for the dance will be nice casual. Jeans are okay.
				Please keep your costume or clothing tasteful in accordance with the standards of the Living Church of God.
				We should not be as concerned with being in style as we are having a good time and respecting one another.
				Thank you very much for your consideration in this!</i></b></p>

				<h2>Costume Judging</h2>
				
				<p>This year&#39;s costume dance will have a theme of &quot;Royalty.&quot; Come dressed in your finest as a
				regal king, queen or any member of a royal court.  Or take a creative interpretation of the theme as a court
				jester, Princess Di, chess board king, Don King, Larry King, King Kong, Queen Latifa, or simply impersonate
				a player of a local sports team (they do the same thing) such as the Chiefs or Royals.</p>
				
				<p><i>NOTE: If you are not wearing a costume, the dress code for the dance will be nice casual. Jeans are okay. Please 
				keep your costume or clothing tasteful in accordance with the standards of the Living Church of God. We should 
				not be as concerned with being in style as we are having a good time and respecting one another. Thank you very 
				much for your consideration in this! You might think twice before dressing up as one of the following or similar: 
				The King of Pop, Queen, Prince, the Artist Formerly Known as Prince, or the Second Coming of Prince.</i></p>  

				<p>Our judges will decide who has the best (and worst) interpretation of the theme.  These are the costume 
				categories for awards this year:</p>
				
				<p><b>King:</b> Best adult (18 +) male costume</p>
